         Suzaku Law
     </div>
     <div>
         <p>
             This is the law which states that I am too sleepy to write about suzaku. I'll write about you tomorrow. Love from Euphy~. lolololol
         </p>
         <p>
             In case C.C. is found wandering around she must be lured in by pizza. If by chance suzaku shows up he must get a series of shock images by c.c. immediately. It will confuse him for a while but you'll be able to escape. Oh and there is no danger to c.c as she cannot die! but doesn't mean you can cut her up like mao wanted to. That damn sadist.

             In case C.C. is found unexpectedly staring at you. You must know that she infact doesn't care about it. She is a witch whose sole purpose is to eat pizza. If C.C. hears me she might give me geass. Ugh, the deathly power. I must stay clear of even touching c.c. Though I sometimes wonder hwat kind of shock wave images I might receive. Ugh Ugh. Lulu only you can save us ;~;
