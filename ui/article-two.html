             This is the law which states that you must obey every order of Lelouch because he has the power of king, the absolute power which makes anyone do as he commands. Look into his eyes and be blessed. Lelouch vi Britannia commands you to follow his every order.

             Lelouch has two wishes. One to create a peaceful world for his little sister nunnally and second to avenge the death of his mother lady marianne. Even though she is still alive (spoiler) Anyway, to do so he acquires the power of geass from a mysterious girl C.C. He uses this power to fight against the kingdom of britannia with the help of black knights.

             While he is a britannian he lives everyday loathing his country and his father who sent him and his little sister nunally as bargain chip to japan. He knew he'd die there. Anyway miraculously he survives and finds a friend suzaku who is actually the devicer of the white helmet that's current;y causing his group of black knights. But fear not Lelouch has Kallen! Lelouch ultimately gets his dream fulfilled and now spends his life with C.C. while driving a cart. LOLOLOL
